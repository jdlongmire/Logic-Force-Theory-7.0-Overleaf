\begin{abstract}
Quantum mechanics (QM) has been one of the most successful scientific theories, yet its foundational interpretation remains unresolved. The stochastic nature of wavefunction collapse, the nonlocality of entanglement, and the measurement problem suggest the need for additional structure. Logic Force Theory (LFT) introduces logical necessity as a governing constraint on QM, ensuring deterministic state selection, structured entanglement, and entropy suppression. This paper formally develops LFTâ€™s mathematical foundation, demonstrates its alignment with experimental quantum results, and presents computational simulations validating its predictions. Key tests are proposed for evaluating LFT against standard QM, with implications for quantum computing, information theory, and foundational physics.
